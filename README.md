### Project for the Material UI/ReactJS

Download the code & run **npm install** to install dependencies before starting the app.

You'll also need to install Material UI as a dependency. To do this run **npm install @material-ui/core**

To view and sample in developer mode:
1) Open a terminal in the root and run: 'json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000'
2) Assuming port 8000 is open and running, now run in another terminal: npm run start
3) A website example should open up, on the 'Create' page you can input data and it's displayed on the home page.
